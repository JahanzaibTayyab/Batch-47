// These two interfaces are completely
// transferrable in a structural type system:
let ball = { diameter: 10 };
let sphere = { diameter: 20 };
console.log("ðŸš€ ~ file: step05c_structural_typing_object_literals.ts:14 ~ ball:", ball);
console.log("ðŸš€ ~ file: step05c_structural_typing_object_literals.ts:15 ~ sphere:", sphere);
sphere = ball;
console.log("ðŸš€ ~ file: step05c_structural_typing_object_literals.ts:24 ~ sphere:", sphere);
ball = sphere;
console.log("ðŸš€ ~ file: step05c_structural_typing_object_literals.ts:26 ~ ball:", ball);
let tube = { diameter: 12, length: 3 };
//tube = ball;//Error
ball = tube;
console.log("ðŸš€ ~ file: step05c_structural_typing_object_literals.ts:47 ~ ball:", ball);
// Because a ball does not have a length, then it cannot be
// assigned to the tube variable. However, all of the members
// of Ball are inside tube, and so it can be assigned.
// TypeScript is comparing each member in the type against
// each other to verify their equality.
//===================================================
// Now lets do it Case By Case
//Case when "FRESH"" object literal are assigned to a variable
//Rule: When a fresh object literal is assigned to a variable or passed for a parameter of a non-empty target type,
//it is an error for the object literal to specify properties that don't exist in the target type.
//The rationale for the below two errors is that since the fresh types of the object literals are
//never captured in variables, static knowledge of the excess or misspelled properties should not be silently lost.
let myType = { name: "Zia", id: 1 };
//Case 1
myType = { id: 2, name: "Tom" };
myType = { id: 3, name: "Jahanzaib" };
var x; //Note now 'x' can have any name, just that the property should be of type string
x = { id: 1, fullname: "Zia khan" }; // Ok, `fullname` matched by index signature
x = { id: 1, age: 60 };
x = { id: 1, firstName: "Zia", lastName: "Khan" };
console.log("ðŸš€ ~ file: step05c_structural_typing_object_literals.ts:91 ~ x:", x);
//Case 3
//myType = { id: 2, name: "Tom", age: 22 }; //Case 3: Error, excess property
//=================================================
//Case when STALE object literal are assigned to a variable
let myType2 = { id: 2, name: "Tom" };
//Case 1
myType = myType2; //Case 1: can only assign a type which has the the same properties, rule same for fresh and stale object
let myType3 = { id: 2, name_person: "Tom" };
//Case 2a
//myType = myType3; //Case 2: Error, renamed or missing property, rule same for stale and fresh object
//Case 2b
//A type can include an index signature to explicitly indicate that excess properties are permitted in with fresh objects:
//var x: { id: number; [x: string]: any }; //Note now 'x' can have any name, just that the property should be of type string
var y = { id: 1, fullname: "Zia", age: 60 };
x = y; // Ok, `fullname` matched by index signature
//y = x; // Error
var myType4 = { id: 2, name: "Tom", age: 22 };
//Case 3
myType = myType4; //Case 3: Ok, excess property allowed in case of stale object which is different from fresh object
let error1;
//error1 = { foo: 1, baz: 2 }; // Error, excess property `baz`
var error2;
//error2 = { foo: 1, baz: 2 }; // Error, excess or misspelled property `baz`
var a;
var a1 = { foo: 1, baz: 2 };
a = a1; //No Error
var z;
var z1 = { foo: 1, baz: 2 };
z = z1; //No Error
export {};
